| [Vector](https://github.com/GohEeEn/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/master/src/Vector)                       | It is a sequence ADT that supports the insertion, removal and accessing of objects based on **rank**, which is the _number of elements before any object_ in vector (higher rank)                                                                                   |

| [Sequence](https://github.com/GohEeEn/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/master/src/Sequence)                   | A structure that contains a series of objects, which is the **combination of vector and list**, that allows the insertion, removal and accessing based on both _rank and position_                                                                                  |
| [Iterator](https://github.com/GohEeEn/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/master/src/Sequence)                   | An ADT that define the **iteration through each elements** in a structure / a series of objects                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [Tree](https://github.com/GohEeEn/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/master/src/Tree)                           | A hierarchical ADT where data / elements are related in terms of **parent-child relationships**                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [Binary Tree](https://github.com/GohEeEn/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/master/src/Tree#bt)                 | A tree structure which has their individual node **at most 2 children nodes**, as the reference of _left and right_ children nodes                                                                                                                                  |
| [Binary Search Tree](https://github.com/GohEeEn/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/master/src/BinarySearchTree) | A binary tree which individual node stores a unique value, and the relationship between parent and children nodes is defined in a total-order relation as **_left-child ~ parent ~ right-child_**                                                                   |
