/* Recursive Binary Search */

/*
	Divide-and-conquer algorithm :
	
	Problem : 
		find a key k in an array z[ 0 , 1 , ... , n-1 ] in sorted order
		
	Steps :
	1. Compare key k with z[n/2]
	2. Depending on the result 
		a. Recurse either on the first half of array, z[ 0 , ... , n/2 - 1 ]
		b. Recurse on the second half of array, z[ n/2 , ... , n - 1 ]
	
	Recurrence Relation :
	>> Called on subarray of length approximately n / 2
	>> There are c comparisons in the worst case before a recursive call is needed again
	>> T(n) = T(n/2) + c

		T(n)	The worst-case time of the algorithm needed
		n		The array length
		c		Number of comparison needed in the worst case before a recursive call is needed again
