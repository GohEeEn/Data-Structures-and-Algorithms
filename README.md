Implementation of common data structures and algorithms in Java

## Data Structures

Data Structure | Description
--|--
[Stack](https://github.com/GohEeEn/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/master/Java/Stack) | A container of values / objects which do the insertion and removal of elements based on **Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)** principle
[Queue](https://github.com/GohEeEn/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/master/Java/Queue) | A container of values / objects which does the insertion and removal of elements based on **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)** principle
[Vector](https://github.com/GohEeEn/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/master/Java/Vector) | It is a sequence ADT that supports the insertion, removal and accessing of objects based on **rank**, which is the *number of elements before any object* in vector (higher rank)
[List](https://github.com/GohEeEn/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/master/Java/List) | A structure that supports insertion and removal of objects based on **[position](https://github.com/GohEeEn/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/master/Java/Common/Position.java)**, an auxiliary ADT for ADTS in which the *values are stored at specific position*
[Sequence](https://github.com/GohEeEn/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/master/Java/Sequence) | A structure that contains a series of objects, which is the **combination of vector and list**, that allows the insertion, removal and accessing based on both *rank and position*
[Iterator](https://github.com/GohEeEn/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/master/Java/Sequence) | An ADT that define the **iteration through each elements** in a structure / a series of objects
