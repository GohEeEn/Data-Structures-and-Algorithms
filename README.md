## Data Structures

Data Structure | Description
--|--
[Stack](https://github.com/GohEeEn/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/master/src/Stack) | A container of values / objects which do the insertion and removal of elements based on **Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)** principle
[Queue](https://github.com/GohEeEn/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/master/src/Queue) | A container of values / objects which does the insertion and removal of elements based on **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)** principle
[Vector](https://github.com/GohEeEn/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/master/src/Vector) | It is a sequence ADT that supports the insertion, removal and accessing of objects based on **rank**, which is the *number of elements before any object* in vector (higher rank)
[List](https://github.com/GohEeEn/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/master/src/List) | A structure that supports insertion and removal of objects based on **[position](https://github.com/GohEeEn/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/master/src/Common/Position.java)**, an auxiliary ADT for ADTS in which the *values are stored at specific position*
[Sequence](https://github.com/GohEeEn/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/master/src/Sequence) | A structure that contains a series of objects, which is the **combination of vector and list**, that allows the insertion, removal and accessing based on both *rank and position*
[Iterator](https://github.com/GohEeEn/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/master/src/Sequence) | An ADT that define the **iteration through each elements** in a structure / a series of objects
[Tree](https://github.com/GohEeEn/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/master/src/Tree) | A hierarchical ADT where data / elements are related in terms of **parent-child relationships**
[Binary Tree](https://github.com/GohEeEn/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/master/src/Tree#bt) | A tree structure which has their individual node **at most 2 children nodes**, as the reference of *left and right* children nodes
[Binary Search Tree](https://github.com/GohEeEn/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/master/src/BinarySearchTree) | A binary tree which individual node stores a unique value, and the relationship between parent and children nodes is defined in a total-order relation as <br> ***left-child ~ parent ~ right-child***
